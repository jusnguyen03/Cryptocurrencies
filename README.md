# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview
I will be diving deeper into machine learning using unsupervised algorithms, which help us explore data when we’re not sure what we’re looking for. I can analyze data without a clear output in mind. I will be:
  - Describing the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each.
  - Preprocessing data for unsupervised learning.
  - Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
  - Determining the best amount of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
  - Using PCA to limit features and speed up the model.

## Resources
- Data Source: crypto_data.csv
- Software: python, jupyter notebook, vs code

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, I will use unsupervised learning to analyze data on the cryptocurrencies traded on the market.

The goals for this challenge are:
  1. Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.
  2. Reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn.
  3. Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.
  4. Create some plots and data tables to present your results.
